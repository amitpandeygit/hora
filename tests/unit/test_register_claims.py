"""Keep docs/not-yet-consumed.md's *claims* true, not just its membership.

`test_not_yet_consumed.py` checks that every constant is either consumed by a
calculation or listed in the register. It does not check that what the register
*says* about a listed constant is true.

That gap let twenty constants sit under a heading reading "Published through
`/v1/util/tables/*` and `/v1/reference/*`" while being published nowhere —
seventeen of them not even re-exported from `hora.core.const`. The register was
honest about them being unconsumed and wrong about them being reachable.

So the claim is now a test.
