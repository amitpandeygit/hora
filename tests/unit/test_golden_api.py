"""Replay every recorded API response and fail on any difference.

This is the safety net for refactoring. The engine's behaviour is defined by
what the endpoints return; if a rearrangement of the code changes any of it,
that is a regression until someone says otherwise.

Comparison is deep equality on the parsed JSON, not on raw bytes: key order in
a JSON object is not part of the contract, but every key and every value is.

To change the contract deliberately:

    python scripts/capture_golden.py

and review the diff. There is no way to make this test pass by accident.
