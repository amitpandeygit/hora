"""Keep docs/not-yet-consumed.md honest.

The register lists data that exists and is verified but that no calculation
uses. A stale register is worse than none: it would let "chapter N is done" go
on meaning "chapter N is working" long after that stopped being true.

So the register is checked against the code both ways:

  - everything it lists must really be unconsumed
  - everything unconsumed must really be listed

Either drift fails. When something becomes consumed, delete it from the
register and this test goes green again.
