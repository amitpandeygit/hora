# §25.2's caveat on its own tables
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: valence; the natal chart supplies the subject. §25.2 says so before printing
#: a single one of them.

    "These results are given only for reference. In reality, not everyone "
    "with the same janma rasi experiences the same results on a given day (or "
    "week or month). The results given by planets depend on what they stand "
    "for in the natal chart."
)

#: §25.2's own illustration, twice over on one transit: Mars in the 8th from
#: janma rasi gives worries either way, and *what* the worries are about comes
#: from the house Mars lords natally.

     "result": "worries", "about": "career"},
)

#: **Finding.** This is §18.4's shape again. There the sixteen dasa principles
#: gave a placement's valence and the subject came from the house (OI-122);
#: here the seven transit tables give the valence and the subject comes from
#: natal lordship. Both sections say the table is not the reading.
THE_TABLE_IS_NOT_THE_READING = (
    "§25.2's tables give what a transit does -- worries, gains, illness -- and "
    "never what it is about. The subject comes from what the graha lords in "
    "the natal chart, which is the same division of labour §18.4 makes for "
    "dasas."
)

#: asserts this matches what is actually built, so the section cannot be
